Installation Instructions
=========================

This release contains two files:
	comment.php
	postcomment.php

To use, place the following lines of text where you want to use it.

	<?php
		date_default_timezone_set('UTC');

		include("comment.php");
		comment("index");
	?>

where index is the name of the page that will contain the comments.  The call to
date_default_timezone_set() is needed to avoid a warning when calling the date()
function.  A timezone other than UTC may be used.
